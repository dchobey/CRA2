 Remarks: A beautiful place to dine in.The interiors take you back to the Mughal era. The lightings are just perfect.We went there on the occasion of Christmas and so they had only limited items available. But the taste and service was not compromised at all.The only complaint is that the breads could have been better.Would surely like to come here again.

 Remarks: I had a very bad experience here.\nI don't know about a la carte, but the buffet was the worst. They gave us complementary drink and momos before the buffet. The momos were really good.\nThe number of varieties first of all was very disappointing. The service was very slow. They refilled the food very slowly. The starters were okay. The main course also was so so. There was two gravies with roti and some rice with raitha. They had chats, sev puri and pan puri, which was average. But the desert was disappointing. They had gulab Jamun and chocolate cake. The jamun was not cooked inside. There was a cold blob of raw dough inside. The chocolate cake also was really hard and not that good.\nOverall the buffet was a bad experience for me."

 Remarks:  One of my favourite places that I often visit in South bangalore , but quality has been reduced than before. Little unhappy with the food this time.\nBut their churros never dissapointed me. Staff are too slow and do not respond easily.\n\nSoups:\nMinestrone soup was like vegetable stock water with vegetables in it, not happy with it.\n\nChurros :\nIt was great as usual. A must visit place if u love churros.\n\nStarters:\n1. Africano panner -\nIt was bit sweet and not happy with the dish!!\n2. Loaded nachos -\nThis happened to be their one of the best dishes, but now I take back my words. Very dissapointed with the dish.\n\nMain course:\nsicilia pizza\nPizza was too good, it's a must try dish.\n\nFinally I would recommend this place for churros and pizza .\n\nTaste : 6/10\nAmbience :7/10\nValue for money : 8/10\n\nOverall experience : 7.5/10"

 Remarks:  Though very sadly the place looks in need of retouching, but the food was great! Especially when it was super cold outside and we were super hungry, the staff was nice. We ordered the pink pasta and a pizza. Both of them were pretty good. Was really tempted to try their Churros but we were stuffed. Worth a visit and try for sure!'

 Remarks:  Churros, the restaurant's eponymous offering, has to be tried. They're a Mexican snack and served with chocolate sauce. Milkshakes are good too. The interior walls have murals and writings all over. Haven't tried the pizzas here but the cakes and pastries were pretty good."

 Remarks:  Visited this place for the first time, recently. The ambience was pretty good. We ordered two 'churros for two'. Having churros for the first time ever, I was way too excited and judgmental. But swear to Lord, the churros were heavenly! The chocolate sauce was the actual chocolate sauce and not nutella xD We had taken the Cross Country Ranch pizza. It was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggies.\nThe place is famous for churros the name suggests so). I would love to visit again to try all the other items out :')"

 Remarks:  2nd time I have visited this place and I am surprised to see how it has declined. Churros was hard, pizza was pathetic, loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO! Yes mayonnese.. Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state, mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding... This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience, pretty slow and inattentive staff. Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499, We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed!! Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower. I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other. That'll be my last visit San Churros.")]

The staff here serves in a traditional Mysore style dresses. The food is authentic Karnataka meals. I really liked the pineapple pickle/chutney. They serve some 4 varities of rice of which you shouldn't try all as you would already be full. Roti, Dosa were decent.

 Remarks:  I have a confession, being a south Indian I distaste south Indian food not that I hate it, I don\'t like it either).But still made up my mind on Sankaranti to have authentic south Indian food visited "Adduri Udupi Bhojana" because it was close to my place.I just had a look at the menu told myself that I can do it I am not blessed with a tremendous appetite).welcomed with the mango soup followed by the wide variety of dishes served, I have developed the new love for Pongal both sweet and Khara).I can still feel the taste of the ghee bursting in my mouth but it was"kai holige" that made my day, crisp and soft.not to forget food is served on a banana leaf that adds in more flavor and taste.waiters are attentive and responsive.The customer\'s needs are monitored and addressed.so much variety for just 160Rs without compromising on quantity and quality and yes it is unlimited.This visit turned out to be a surprise package.'

 Remarks:  I have a confession, being a south Indian I distaste south Indian food not that I hate it, I don\'t like it either).But still made up my mind on Sankaranti to have authentic south Indian food visited "Adduri Udupi Bhojana" because it was close to my place.I just had a look at the menu told myself that I can do it I am not blessed with a tremendous appetite).welcomed with the mango soup followed by the wide variety of dishes served, I have developed the new love for Pongal both sweet and Khara).I can still feel the taste of the ghee bursting in my mouth but it was"kai holige" that made my day, crisp and soft.not to forget food is served on a banana leaf that adds in more flavor and taste.waiters are attentive and responsive.The customer\'s needs are monitored and addressed.so much variety for just 160Rs without compromising on quantity and quality and yes it is unlimited.This visit turned out to be a surprise package.'

 Remarks:  Been here a couple of times. Highly satisfying on both the ocassions. Great food. Decent service. At price of 160 per person it is of a great value. The staff here serves in a traditional Mysore style dresses. The food is authentic Karnataka meals. I really liked the pineapple pickle/chutney. They serve some 4 varities of rice of which you shouldn't try all as you would already be full. Roti, Dosa were decent. In the deserts, Payasam& Holige were good.\nI think it is one the must try places to try some authentic south food even if you have been to the likes of Kamath etc. this one is a little different. :)"

Service is bit fast as people will be coming, but they will make it slow if u tell them to. Then comes rice with sambar,rasam, daal,tambali. And yes, dont forget to eat holige,payasam and icecream.

 Remarks:  2nd time I have visited this place and I am surprised to see how it has declined. Churros was hard, pizza was pathetic, loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO! Yes mayonnese.. Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state, mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding... This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience, pretty slow and inattentive staff. Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499, We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed!! Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower. I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other. That'll be my last visit San Churros.")]

 Remarks: I like going back to this place. I really like the ambience and the fact that it is a rooftop makes it a cool place to hangout. Although, I keep ordering almost the same thing every time, it has always turned out to be a nice experience. This place is famous for its pizza but, I kinda like their pasta more. Also, the tiramisu shots are to die for and so is the mozzarella cheese balls with a really generous amount of cheese inside. I would surely recommend this place and I would definitely keep going back.'

 Remarks: This is one of the biggest Onesta outlets I've visited. In the last couple of years, Onesta has made a name for itself. We did not have pizza places that have a buffet option.\n\nLike any other Onesta, the taste is right up there and the quick service. I like the thin crust pizzas here. I'd recommend you to take the buffet, ordering a la carte is not pocket friendly."

 Remarks: Food : 4/5\nService: 10/5\nSo let's get over the food and the ambience first. Restaurant is big, with high roof, give a sense of space, well lit. Food is great, not mind blowing. We took the unlimited menu, and loved the bacon pizza most. Rest of the pizza was good enough. Among the deserts, the walnut tart was superb, but i didn't like the peanut-butter mousse at all.\n\nBut, in spite of all that, the reason for the 5-star rating is the service we got. We were served by Mr.Nanda, who made us feel absolutely special. He didn't have to. We were a small party of just two people, we weren't ordering off the main menu, and the restaurant discourages tips. In spite of all that, he was extremely attentive

 Remarks: Food : 4/5\nService: 10/5\nSo let's get over the food and the ambience first. Restaurant is big, with high roof, give a sense of space, well lit. Food is great, not mind blowing. We took the unlimited menu, and loved the bacon pizza most. Rest of the pizza was good enough. Among the deserts, the walnut tart was superb, but i didn't like the peanut-butter mousse at all.\n\nBut, in spite of all that, the reason for the 5-star rating is the service we got. We were served by Mr.Nanda, who made us feel absolutely special. He didn't have to. We were a small party of just two people, we weren't ordering off the main menu, and the restaurant discourages tips. In spite of all that, he was extremely attentive

The entrance is weird and you feel better only after ending up on the 4th floor.\nThe place is really tiny and seems good. Only thing that seemed nice about the place. We had the Nachos, cheese and salsa. The mayo along with this was so runny and milky. The cheese was only on the top layer and the below ones didn't have any.

Masala tea was not even brewed and was made out of tea bags which was priced at 120 Rs. Left it after two sips.\n\nPesto Garlic bread was average but was priced at 200 Rs! Virgin mojito tasted like it was just sweet sugar syrup with a hint of lime.\n\nOverall not worth the price being charged for the quality of food.

The ambience is good for a small gathering and hang out. Not exactly the kind of place for fine dining.\n\nIt doesn't seem to be like a popular hang out. It is hard to even know if a cafe is existing there.\n\nHaving Zomato gold membership works out well. It was due to that we identified the place and went till there to utilise the benefit. Thank you Zomato for the Gold :-) !!\n\n

The entrance is weird and you feel better only after ending up on the 4th floor.\nThe place is really tiny and seems good. Only thing that seemed nice about the place. We had the Nachos, cheese and salsa. The mayo along with this was so runny and milky. The cheese was only on the top layer and the below ones didn't have any.

 Remarks: If possible I would give even less. The pizza is horrible as they serve it on pre-cooked pizza bread. Makes the pizza super chewy. The worst of all was the main that we ordered. They gave us raw chicken and when complied about it they just cooked the same chicken again making it over cooked and super chewy. Would not recommend it to anyone.'

 Remarks: This cute comic book themed cafe is one of the closest hangout places for college students. It is fun if you go with a group of friends. The food is kinda good but not that great. Pasta Alfredo has too much cheese which kinda starts making you sick of it. I don't know if that should be considered a good point or a bad one xD Also, I wish they gave garlic bread with pasta and not the regular one :

 Remarks: This cute comic book themed cafe is one of the closest hangout places for college students. It is fun if you go with a group of friends. The food is kinda good but not that great. Pasta Alfredo has too much cheese which kinda starts making you sick of it. I don't know if that should be considered a good point or a bad one xD Also, I wish they gave garlic bread with pasta and not the regular one :

Since it's not too crowded, this is a good place to catch up with friends for a long conversation.\n\nI've been here on multiple occasions and haven't been disappointed any time.

 Remarks: Though the presentation of the place and food looked good, nothing that i ordered tasted good here. For starters, though the name says Coffee Shack, there is hardly any coffee options. The masala tea was machine brewed, the hot chocolate tasted like watery bournvita milk amd the garlic bread was very salty.\n\nThe management has to put in extra efforts to deliver good food.'

 Remarks: Cozy and comfy place located in hoskerehalli near banashankari 2nd stage. Easily identifiable as it is located in the busy main road.\n\nFood:\n1)veg paneer pizza which is of thin crust. Tasted very dry and wasn't hot.\n2)twistato was tasteful. Where two pieces are served in a plate with tomato and mayo sauce.\n3)virgin mojito was refreshing in the end.\n\nService:\nWas quiet quick and staff people were friendly.\n\nAmbience: Outdoor seating available with plants around you. But it seemed to be like a smoking zone.\nWhen you enter inside,it's quiet spacious with many seatings and books around you with all photos on the walls related to food.\nThere is one more section if you go inside,where screening is available."

 Remarks: \n\nHorrible. Not even kidding. We ordered BBQ chicken wings and chef's special pizza. They gave undercooked chicken wings and the sauce on it was not even BBQ sauce. It was some local sauce with little spices in it. Pizza hardly had toppings on it. Staffs were so irresponsible. We had to tell them to give us the plates and cups after waiting for so long time . Also food delivery is so late. You order it now, you get it literally half an hour late."

 Remarks:  Ordered in from the cafe so can't say much about the ambience.. the food however was good. Loved the chicken lasagna which was spicy and flavourful. Had also ordered fish fingers but found those only okay. It lacked the fishy flavor and tasted like normal fried chicken fingers. Will probably visit here soon to be able to give a better detailed review. Would give it a 3.5 but the restaurant gets the benefit of a 4 because of the 5 point scale.."
